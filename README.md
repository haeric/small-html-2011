Small HTML 2011
===============

The winning entry for the [small html competition](http://www.gathering.org/tg11/en/creative/competitions/small-html/) at The Gathering 2011. 
We were given [this sample image](http://haeric.github.com/small-html-2011/sample.png) and asked to create it with 
the smallest possible amount of code.

The code utilizes `createLinearGradient` to create a gradient at the very top of the canvas, 
which is then used as a palette for the rest of the canvas.

The improved version is the currently smallest version I've been able to make, but it's rather ugly as it
only works when the file is minified.
